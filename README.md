# Chili Room Editor

Simple, local-only web app to:

1. Upload a 128xH PNG tileset (width 128, height <= 128)
2. Slice it into tiles (choose 8 / 16 / 32 px)
3. Paint a 16x16 tile map (logical 8x8 cells displayed scaled for clarity)
4. Export the map as a C array of tile indices

No servers, no builds â€” just open `index.html` in a modern browser. All data (tileset + map) is stored in `localStorage`.

## Features

- 128xH (H <= 128) PNG tileset upload (validated)
- Tile size selection: 8, 16, or 32 (must evenly divide 128)
- Auto-sliced tile palette with pixelated rendering
- Click to select a tile as the active brush
- 16x16 map grid (stores tile indices; -1 = empty) displayed at a fixed 32px per logical tile for crisp editing
- Erase mode toggle
- Persistent state (reload page and continue where you left off)
- Export to C array (copy or download `.h` file)

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
2. Upload your 128xH PNG tileset (e.g., 128x80 works)
3. Pick a tile size and (optionally) click Re-slice
4. Click a tile in the palette to make it the brush
5. Paint on the map canvas (left click / drag)
6. Toggle Erase mode to remove tiles
7. Export to C when ready

## Export Format

Output example:

```c
// Generated by Chili Room Editor
#define ROOM_W 16
#define ROOM_H 16
static const int roomMap[ROOM_W*ROOM_H] = {
	0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
	-1, -1, -1, -1, ...
	// ... remaining rows ...
};
```

Tile indices correspond to the order tiles are sliced (row-major from the uploaded tileset). Empty cells are `-1`.

## Display Scaling

Each logical tile is rendered at a fixed 32px square in the editor (regardless of slice size). This avoids browser interpolation blurriness while staying large enough for accurate painting. Exported data only contains tile indices; no scale metadata is added.

## Development Notes

This is intentionally dependency-free. If you want to extend:

- Add multi-map support
- Support multiple layers (foreground/background)
- Allow arbitrary tileset widths
- Animate tiles / metadata per tile
- JSON export alongside C

## Reset / Clearing

- Use Clear Map to set all cells to -1
- Use Clear Tileset to remove the tileset and palette
- Use browser devtools > Application > Local Storage to manually purge

## Browser Compatibility

Tested in recent desktop Chromium + Firefox. Mobile works for basic painting (touch events), but UI is not optimized.
